Submitted by: **Nelson Wang**

**Trivia Game** is an app that ... [TODO] 

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:
  - [x] Number of questions
  - [x] Category of questions
  - [x] Difficulty of questions
  - [x] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
- [x] User can tap a button to start trivia game, this presents questions and answers in a List or Card view.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User has answer marked as correct or incorrect after submitting choices (alongside their score).
